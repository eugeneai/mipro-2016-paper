% Some very useful LaTeX packages include:
% (uncomment the ones you want to load)


% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/ifpdf
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of the IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 5.0 (2009-03-20) and later if using hyperref.sty.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/cite
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation
% can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/graphicx
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/epslatex
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). The IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics.
%
% Note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/amsmath





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as the IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithms
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithmicx




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/array


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a larger sans serif font
% than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
% and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending
% on whether compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/subfig




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
% corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
% be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/url
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.




% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

\section{Introduction}

Reverse engineering of the compiled software (a program after processing its source code by a compiler) is an important task in software engineering as it allows one to solve a wide variety of software quality assessment problems, such as productivity of compiled code, quality of compiler and system libraries, peculiarities of hardware architectures the program running on.  Reverse engineering is also used for regain the access to legacy code, whose source counterpart is already lost, and for investigation of virus and malicious program behavior.  One of the main part of any reverse engineering technologies is a construction and analysis of so-called control flow graph that reflect a general structure of corresponding algorithms.  Artificial intelligence techniques such as pattern recognition and rewrite rule engines have extensive use in the analysis.

The control flow graph is a natural representation that can be automatically figured out from the source code of its compiled binaries.  The graph is used by compiler as an intermediate structure for optimizing transformations.  The source code text contains all the necessary information on program behavior.  Its analysis usually is a complex task even with technological support of nowadays integrated development environments, which make it significantly easier.

Binary code analysis is a more complex task, and it requires a wide variety of IT knowledge.  Special software such as disassemblers and decompilers are used for this purpose.  The decompiling of a runtime is in principle an impracticable task: the reconstructed high-level code is more difficult in understanding as compared to its assembler counterpart.  The visual analysis of the control flow is an alternate way.  There are number of visual representation and processing software, which are universal enough, such as uDraw (daVinci)~\cite{10}, VCG~\cite{14}, Graphlet~\cite{12}, GraVis~\cite{13}, Graph Drawing Server~\cite{9}, graphViz~\cite{11}, VisualGraph~\cite{15}.  These systems have a broad toolkits, but visualization and analysis of control flow graph requires a special processing routines.

Algorithms of graph visualization are developed since \nnn{60-ties}~\cite{7}.  The works of P.~Eades~\cite{5}, T.~Kamada~\cite{q1}, and S.~Kawai~\cite{6} considered to be classical in this research field and devoted to universal approaches to graph visualization problems.  The control flow graph is directed and usually visualized by means of layers~\cite{4}.  The process consists of four stages:
\begin{description}
\item [Distribution of graph nodes in a layer.] Each node is assigned a rank.  All directed arcs can connect nodes from a lower rank to a higher one.  Nodes of the same rank cannot be connected with arcs.  Rank distribution of the nodes is performed with various techniques, the simplest one is based on path length calculation in depth-first graph traversal procedure.
\item[Defining order on the nodes of a layer.] The nodes of a layer are ordered according to principle of minimization of intersections of \nnn{the arcs !WE SAID that THERE ARE NO CONNECTIONS of THE NODES OF THE SAME RANK!}.  \nnn{Method of median}~\cite{8} is most widely used technique for solving the problem.
\item[Figuring out of the node coordinates in a layer.] Each node of the each layer is assigned a coordinate so as the graph will correspond to predefined aesthetic criteria.

\item[Arc drawing.] On this stage the arcs are drawn according to \nnn{criteria}, for example, arcs can be indirect lines.
\end{description}

The paper presents a technique for analyzing and visualizing the control flow graph of a compiled software. The analysis is based on semantically equivalent transformations of the original graph resulting in an abstract node that contains a hierarchy of isolated regions, which then associated with predefined templates to form resulting graphical representation.  The templates and additional signature data for library modules allow one to recognize among the subgraphs the high--level programming language structures and statements used, e.g., to construct flow--chart notation of the original program.

\section{Some WONDERFUL basis and theory}

\nnn{According to the technique, program's graph of control flow is separated  on regions having one input and one output node, then the regions are replaced with abstract nodes.}

\subsection{Quality criteria of the control flow graph visualization}

The main criterion of quality of control graph visualization is the correspondence of the image to the nature of the visualized informational object. The quality assessment depends on various structural and systematical characteristics of the object.  Three basis features are emphasized specially among the criteria: \nnn{visual arrangement, aesthetics, restrictions}.
\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{Visual arrangement} \nnn{WE NEED CONSTRUCTIVE DEFINITION!! NOT A CONSTRAINTS!!}
\item \emph{aesthetics}
\item \emph{restrictions}
\end{itemize}

A control flow graph that was reconstructed from a binaries consists of operator block nodes, starting node, and an non-empty set of finish nodes, as well as edges corresponding to transfer of control.  A natural image of the control flow graph is a flowchart diagram.  For the flow charts we define the following \nnn{visual arrangement} for its nodes (Fig.~\ref{fig:blocks}).

\section{Control flow graph visualizing}
\label{sec:cfg-vis}

Nowadays programming languages in most cases contain a standard set of high--level control flow operators (if--then, if--then--else, for, while, etc.).  These operators when compiled produce their specific subgraphs.  For example, if--then operator produces a graph depicted in Fig.~\ref{fig:IfSt}, where ``then'' part could correspond to another control subgraph.
\begin{figure}[htbp]
	\centering
		\includegraphics[width=0.15\textwidth]{Pic/Pic2.eps}
	\caption{Subgraph of if--then operator}
	\label{fig:IfSt}
\end{figure}

One can describe a corresponding subgraph for all standard high--level language flow control operators.  Each generated subgraph is described as a template.  The control operators are revealed and reconstructed in whole flow control graph by means of recognition of the templates in the graph and folding the recognized structure into an abstract node.  The arcs going into and from the abstract node are reconnected accordingly.  The reconstruction process is repeated until either the graph folds into one abstract node, and in this case graph is referred to as \emph{\nnn{reducible}}, or there is a subgraph that does not correspond to any of the templates.  In the last case the graph is called \emph{\nnn{inreducible}}, and the subgraph --- \emph{\nnn{indeterminate}}.

Structural high--level programming languages compiler produces only reducible flow control graphs.  This will hold for most of other languages as long as ``goto'' operator is not used explicitly or implicitly.  There are to approaches for overcoming this problem:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Perform an indeterminate subgraph riddance operation.  The essential disadvantage of the approach is the necessity of addition and deletion of nodes and arcs in the graph, this is not allowed in control flow graph model visualization.
\item Recognize the indeterminate subgraph and replace it with an abstract node.  \nnn{Some COMMENT NEEDED whether IT IS GOOD OR BAD.}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Algorithm of control flow graph structuring}
\label{sec:algor-contr-flow}

The developed algorithm is based on structural analysis technique proposed in~\cite{17} that suggest to recognize subgraph of a predefined form (a template) and replace them with an abstract node, reassigning arc \nnn{terminals} accordingly.  Template application is carried out in depth-first order until the graph folds into one abstract node.  A tree of dominating nodes is constructed.  The tree is used for arc classification and cycle recognition.  The result quality strongly depends on template application order. The algorithm is as follows:

\begin{algorithm}[h]
\SetAlgoLined %% Connects logical parts with lines
\KwData{G, D, P}
\KwResult{An abstract node containing a hierarchy of folded subgraphs}
%\While{$|E| \neq 0$ и $|V| \neq 1$}{
	\ForEach{$v \in D$ in backward order}{
		\ForEach{$p \in Children(v)$}{
			\If{$p\quad pidom\quad v$}{
				$S \leftarrow Children(v) \setminus p $ \\
				\If{$Classify\_Region(S) \neq \textit{indeterminat}$}{
					$Apply\_Template(S)$
				}\Else{
					$Hierarchical\_Placer(S \cup p)$ \\
					$Recognize\_Indeterminant\_Region(S)$
				}
				$Modify(G,D,P)$
			}
		}
	}

We have proposed and implemented a software tools realizing a new approach to surface graph \nnn{raskladka} on the base of techniques of structural analysis.  The tools have been used for structural ... of attributed graphs.  A probation was performed on CPU2000 test set\footnote{https://www.spec.org/cpu2000/ --- Standard Performance Evaluation Corporation.  SPEC CPU2000 is a test set for assessment of the performance of a central processing unit. The test are used for compiler quality evaluation.} and the following \nnn{generalized} results are obtained:
\begin{itemize}
\item 197.parser (Syntactic parser of a natural language);
\item 252.eon (Ray tracing).
\end{itemize}




The automation of the flow control analysis allows engineer to devote more efforts for description of the templates increasing both the productivity and detail level of the software description.
